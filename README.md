## 1. Installation <a name='installation'></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## 2. Project Motivation <a name='project_motivation'></a>

Seattle AirBnb Data Analysis is a project, which explores some information for booking a room in Seattle. We will use Seattle AirBnb data (in 2016, 2017) to explore:
* Question 1: What amenities do Seattle rooms have?
* Question 2: What relates to price of rooms in Seattle?
* Question 3: When is the good time to book a room in Seattle?

This project follows CRISP-DM data science process, which has 6 major phases:

1. Business understanding
2. Data understanding
3. Data preparing
4. Data Modeling
5. Result Evaluation
6. Deployment (excluded in this project)


## 3. File Descriptions <a name='file_descriptions'></a>
There is only one notebook to showcase work as CRISP-DM process to answer the three above questions. Markdown cells are used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

A folder named dataset_SeattleAirbnb contains two dataset files in CSV format.

## 4. Results <a name='results'></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@khanhntn.13qse/how-to-book-the-most-suitable-room-in-seattle-7306b39ed28).

## 5. Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements <a name='licensing'></a>

Must give credit to AirBnB for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
